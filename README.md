# worlds-countries.sql
The world's countries as an sql dump in six languages plus Alpha2 and Alpha3 codes.

I took Stefan Gabos list of all world countries(http://stefangabos.ro/other-projects/list-of-world-countries-with-national-flags/) and added information from some other sources.
As a result there is this list with (hopefully) all world countries in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Russian including there Alpha2 and Alpha3 codes, where not every country has Alpha3.

Due to forking Stefan Gabos list, this repo is distributed under LGPL.
